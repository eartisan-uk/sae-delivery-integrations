# SAE Driver Manifest (GRN)

Prints a Goods Release Note / Driver Manifest for selected internal transport legs
on `staging.mysae.net` (Odoo 18). Built to pair with the A1 list-view tweak
(view id 2927) that exposes Internal / Driver / Vehicle as bulk-editable columns.

## How it works for the operator

1. Open the Transport Legs list.
2. Tick the legs for one run (already stamped with driver + vehicle via A1 bulk edit).
3. Print > **Driver Manifest (GRN)**.
4. One landscape page per distinct driver in the selection: run header, job table,
   loading + driver sign-off block.

## Files

- `__manifest__.py`
- `report/driver_manifest_report.xml` — paperformat + `ir.actions.report` (list binding)
- `report/driver_manifest_templates.xml` — the QWeb run-sheet

## Field bindings

| GRN column | Source |
|---|---|
| Customer | `order_id.partner_id.name` |
| Job No | `picking_id.name` (fallback `reference` / `name`) |
| Del/Coll | `picking_id.picking_type_id.code` (incoming = Collect, else Deliver) |
| Town / Post Code | `from_*` if Collect else `to_*` |
| Description | `picking_id.weight` + `picking_id.package_ids` summary |
| Special Instructions | `from_instructions` if Collect else `to_instructions` |
| Header Driver / Vehicle / Date | `driver_id` / `fleet_id` / leg run date |

## Two things to verify on deploy

1. **`binding_model_id` ref** in `driver_manifest_report.xml` is
   `sale_goods_order.model_sale_transport_leg`. If `sale_goods_order` registers
   the model under a different xml-id, adjust. Confirm via `ir.model` where
   `model = 'sale.transport.leg'`.
2. **`picking_type_id.code`** drives Collect vs Deliver. Confirmed `picking_id`
   is populated on real legs (e.g. leg 17 -> WH/OUT/00021 = outgoing = Deliver).
   If any internal legs have no picking, Del/Coll defaults to Deliver — decide if
   that fallback is acceptable or should read the depot-as-endpoint rule instead.

## Next (step 3, not in this module)

The per-job Collection Detail / Delivery Note (SAE-branded) needs the
`sale.package.line` model inspected for dimensions / qty / goods-description
fields. That is a separate report; this module only covers the run-sheet.

## Note on Excel

For an Excel variant of the same run-sheet, `reports_designer` (already installed)
can template it from the same `sale.transport.leg` selection. The PDF here covers
the day-one print need; add Excel later if required.
